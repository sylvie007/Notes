Steps to validate deployment of dcaf-cmts model:
 - Status of instance should be 'success' in Kiali GUI.
 
 - Deployment graph is succeeded in Argo GUI.
 
 - All 6 pods are up and running in Kubernetes GUI.

	tick-tel-telegraf-75c54444fc-vnpf7 
	tick-chron-chronograf-8665458cd4-fftdp
	e6000-6fdf97977-hrzg5

 - Chornograf should be accessible by link coming in Kiali GUI after instance successfully deployed.
   And 'DCAF' dashboard/graph should be accessible in Chornograf. It should display 4 graphs and 4 Gauge.
   
 - There should be 4 alerts in alert section and alert should be trigger in alert history tab.
   Monitor graph for few minutes. All trigger should be trigger based on input data.
    Alerts: 
	   traffic_high_upstream
	   traffic_high_downstream
	   traffic_low_upstream
	   traffic_low_downstream
 
 - Check logs of policy to check whether policy is triggering properly for all 4 triggers based on input data.
    e.g.:
    Expected Message:
	    Received: {"rule_name": "lower_traffic", "sfid": 1, "dir":"upstream"}
		
	    
		sudo export rate=50000000; export sfid=1; export dir=downstream; sh /opt/app/dcaf-cmts/artifacts/cmts_adapter/policy.sh
