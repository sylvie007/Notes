
APISIX routs creation steps

  Routes for tosca-so and tosca-compiler are created in APISIX through GIN while initializing tosca-so and
	  tosca-compiler pods
	  
	 For creating any route manually in APISIX dashboard we can follow following steps:
	  . Open APISIX dashboard through Kiali.
	  . Go to "Routes" tab. Then click on "Advanced" => "Raw Data Editor" and copy following json
	     with valid values in it
	  
	  
	   {
		  "uri": "{URI_TO_FORWARD_REQUEST}",
		  "name": "{SEVER_NAME}",
		  "methods": [
			"GET",
			"PUT",
			"POST",
			"DELETE"
		  ],
		  "host": "dcaf-cmts-demo-apisix-gateway.cci-dev.com",
		  "upstream": {
			"nodes": [
			  {
				"host": "{TARGET_HOST_NAME}",
				"port": {TARGET_HOST_PORT},
				"weight": 1
			  }
			],
			"type": "roundrobin",
			"hash_on": "vars",
			"scheme": "http",
			"pass_host": "pass"
		  },
		  "status": 1
		}

		URI_TO_FORWARD_REQUEST: URI to be forward. "/compiler/*"
		SEVER_NAME:             Service_name. e.g. "tosca-compiler"
		TARGET_HOST_NAME:       Target host address. e.g. "tosca-compiler.gin.svc.cluster.local" =>  This is the host name of tosca-compiler pod
		TARGET_HOST_PORT:       Port of target host to communicate. e.g. 10010 for tosca-compiler
		
		
		For example following route is gets map for tosca-so:
		https://dcaf-cmts-demo-apisix-gateway.cci-dev.com/compiler/v1/db/models
		
		The input URI "compiler/v1/db/models" is get mapped to "/compiler/*" and to host tosca-compiler.gin.svc.cluster.local:10010
